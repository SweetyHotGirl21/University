    "\n",
    "Geohashing is an outdoor sport activity played around the world since 2008. Contestents need to adventure to a geocoordinate generated by an algorithm that derives randomness from stock market data (as you should all know Eugene Fama's EMH). \n",

    "Now your task is to decode the geohashed secret location by using Nova SBE's geocoordinate, current date (September 18, 2020) as well as the opening of DJIA on that day. Luckily, Python already has a library to calculate the geohasing using the `geohash` function in `antigravity` package:\n",

    "\n",
    "The number $e$, known as [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) (named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler), is a mathematical constant.  It is the base of the natural logarithm. It is the limit of $(1 + \\frac{1}{n})^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest, as your all know from your economics/finance 101 course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 18th century, Euler derived this number through the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e = \\frac{1}{0!}+\\frac{1}{1!}+\\frac{1}{2!}+\\frac{1}{3!}+\\frac{1}{4!}\\dots+\\frac{1}{n!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's stand on the giant's shoulder to get our own $e$. To do so, you need to write a function ```factorial``` to calculate the factorial number given the $n$ and then use ```for loop``` to generate the $e$. Let $n$ go from 0 to 10, and save the derived value of $e$ in a list and print it out when n is an odd number (up to 10).\n",

    "### Question 3 (25 points) Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a classical search method. Given a sorted list of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in the list. Specifically, searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n",

    "1. Implement your own binary search function, with two arguments: a sorted list and a number to be checked, such that function returns the index of the number in the list, if the number is not in the list, print \"The number is not in the list!\". Also print out how many iterations do you need to exhausively search for the number.\n",
